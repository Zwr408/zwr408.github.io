### Research experience
 October,2019   
 Advisor,Professor Zeng, *National microscale laboratory*,USTC
 - Sythethsized silver phosphate of contrallable shape.  
 - Proposed and determined the catalytic properties of 100,110,111 plains are different. 
 - Learn and use the Material Studio 8 (which includes Material Visualizer, forcite,castep and etc.) to conduct the simulation of absorption process at the surface of plains. 

June,2019  
Advisor,Professor Zeng, *National microscale laboratory*,USTC

- Began research in Electro-oxidation of propylene.  Sythethsized Silver halide of contrallable shape.
- Proposed and determined the catalytic properties of different plains are different, using nuclear magnetic resonance to determine the result and using Scanning Electronic Microscopy to characterize the structure of silver halide

May,2019  
Advisor,Professor Zeng, *National microscale laboratory*,USTC
- Began research in Electroreduction of CO2.
- Sythethysized the In particles and other combined materials used as catalyst for electroreduction of CO2, using the acid-treated carbon as the capping agent and InNO3 as metal precursor.
- Learned the use of Gas Chromatograph(GC) and Electrochemical Workstation.
